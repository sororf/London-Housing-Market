# London-Housing-Market
# This project was created to analyse the housing market in London to find if there is any evidence of discrimination against nacionality, religion or race in the mortgage models. It will be an indirect approach, as I don't have access to financial market.
# I intend to analyse the mortgage market by borough, price and demografics to find if the mortgages are being discriminating against the local population, and to find if the credit risk models do that, diretcly or indirectly.
